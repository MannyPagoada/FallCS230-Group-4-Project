# FallCS230-GroupProject
Project Description: Purpose of this project is to develop a start up idea and explore its potential ethical impacts and the safeguards to be implemented. 

Welcome to iLock, we are your car's virtual relentless 24/7 AI security guard.

iLock is an integrated smart connected car alarm system, that can be a retrofit or come pre-installed, designed to improve vehicle safety and security by actively gathering, learning, and processing the user's biometric data. Engineered to be intuitive and easy to use, the system runs via a mobile app and/or an onboard system which allows car owners to monitor, disable, lock, and receive alerts from their vehicles in real-time. The system actively scans for abnormalities and live alerts will be recorded and sent not only to the user but also to the relevant user pre-configured parties such as law enforcement agencies as an added layer of protection against theft. The system will use a hybrid approach when it comes to collecting and processing users’ data. The onboard system will be used for real-time data processing, enhanced privacy and reduced latency. This will ensure the security and privacy of the data as well as produce faster processing. For scalability and system reliability, iLock will use cloud data management. This will be where most computing power takes place to further analyze and process user’s data. This will be done using iLock’s AI-powered system performing extensive data processing and storage in secure cloud servers.

iLock differentiates itself from other car alarm and security systems by providing revolutionary real-time biometric technology data with local processing to enhance security and boost customer privacy compared to other systems. iLock also employs an adaptive well-trained AI system that not only provides accurate information and fast data processing but also adapts to offer highly predictive security measures continuously learning from patterns and behavior. iLock also provides a hybrid approach when it comes to data processing and management. It uses the vehicle’s onboard system for real-time detection and monitoring and is then complemented by cloud-based AI data analytics for speed, reliability, and scalability. Finally, iLock can come pre-installed during the manufacturing process by working with various car manufacturers as well as come in a retrofit kit to install in older vehicles to cover a wider user base.

The primary stakeholders that iLock will focus on include car users who represent the core of the business and who will benefit directly from enhanced vehicle safety, security, and a smart alert system. Vehicle manufacturers would be the second most important stakeholder. This is due to the close partnership and vehicle enhancement steps iLock will either directly add to the manufacturing process through integrated systems and/or to the retrofit process. This direct and indirect relationship with vehicle manufacturers means that iLock will have to address the needs and risks of vehicle manufacturers early on in its planning stages. Local law enforcement agencies can also leverage the AI car alarm and security system to help prevent, deter, or aid with stolen vehicle recovery, processing of attempted theft, or pursuing potential offenders. Additionally, iLock plans to incorporate the car insurance industry as a key stakeholder working together to integrate our system into their offerings helping to benefit both the policyholders in potential rate reduction from more secure car alarm systems as well as the insurers in reduced car theft and break-in claims.
